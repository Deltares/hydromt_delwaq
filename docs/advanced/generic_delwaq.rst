HydroMT and DELWAQ settings
===========================
HydroMT can help you prepare models for DELWAQ but is specifically suited for the generic version between D-Emission and D-Water Quality. 
In this advanced topic, we detailed what are the steps to best make use of HydroMT for this specific version of DELWAQ.

For this case, we take a simplified example: **Total Nitrogen (TN)** released by **households**.

Background information
----------------------
Instead of using  a (previous) version of D-Emissions that can deal with multiple substances, a mew version dealing with single substances only has been introduced. This was done for two reasons:

1. It dramatically reduces the complexity of the code
2. It significantly reduces the runtime per substance

Moreover, the new D-Emissions version no longer allows/requires editing of the Processes Library Tables (proces.asc) by (expert) users, which proved too error prone in practice. As a consequence of the above, the combined use of D-Emissions and D-Water Quality now requires (in case of a multiple substance water quality simulation) the connection of multiple emission output files generated by individual D-Emissions runs (for each of the substances) to a single D-Water Quality simulation.

The new single substance D-Emissions model writes its emission data into two files, always called:

- outdata_em.bin
- outdata_em.txt

In the case that multiple D-Emissions model runs are carried out, e.g. for total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP), it is up to the user to manage these files and avoid that the results for TP overwrite those for TN. This can easily be done in a batch script using the following commandlines:

::

	copy outdata_em.txt %1_em.txt
	copy outdata_em.bin %1_em.bin
	erase outdata_em.txt 
	erase outdata_em.bin
	
	#where %1 matches the run-id equal to the input filename, %1.inp

D-Water Quality is equipped with a series of processes able to read these files and translate them into the appropriate state variables (e.g. NH4, NO3, PON1 etc. for TN; AAP, 
PO4, POP1 for TP). This allows D-Water Quality to simulate their fate in the surface water using standard processes from the library.

This series of processes is called EM_xxx and is currently still embedded in an open processes library dll. This implies that they need to be manually merged into the D-Water Quality 
proc_def file. After correct functioning has been demonstrated, integration with the standard open source version of D-Water Quality is foreseen.

Every individual EM_xxx process extracts by default its EM data from the following files, assumed to be present in the working directory:

- xxx_em.bin
- xxx_em.txt

Alternatively, these filenames can be read from a file assumed to be present in the working directory:

- xxx_em.def

The functionality to distribute the emission data over several state variables (also known as “USEFOR” functionality) is included in the EM_xxx process. Input can be provided by the 
user in the regular way.

In order to connect a D-Water Quality simulation to one or more D-Emissions runs, the following steps need to be taken.

Let XXX be the variable for which D-Emissions has calculated emissions. The user must:

- Ascertain that xxx_em.bin and xxx_em.txt (D-Emissions output files) are present in the run directory
- **OR** Ascertain that xxx_em.def, a file holding references to xxx_em.bin and xxx_em.txt, is present in the run directory
- Activate the relevant process in block 7 of the input file:

::

    CONSTANTS Active_EM_xxx DATA 1

- Optionally, include the relevant input items for this process.

The table below lists the currently available options for xxx, and the equivalent definitions.

==== ============================= =========== ===============================
xxx  EM files                      WQ process  Input to WQ process

BOD  BOD_em.bin and BOD_em.txt OR  EM_BOD      n.a. (all emissions to CBODu)  
     BOD_em.def                                                               
TNI  TNI_em.bin and TNI_em.txt OR  EM_TNI      TNItoNH4, TNItoNO3, TNItoPON1, 
     TNI_em.def                                TNItoPON2, TNItoDON            
TPH  TPH_em.bin and TPH_em.txt OR  EM_TPH      TPHtoPO4, TPHtoAAP, TPHtoPOP1, 
     TPH_em.def                                TPHtoPOP2, TPHtoDOP            
TSS  TSS_em.bin and TSS_em.txt OR  EM_TSS      TSStoIM1, TSStoIM2,            
     TSS_em.def                                TSStoIM3                       
COL  COL_em.bin and COL_em.txt OR  EM_COL      COLtoEColi, COLtoFColi,        
     COL_em.def                                COLtoTColi                     
TRA  TRA_em.bin and TRA_em.txt OR  EM_TRA      n.a. (all emissions to cTR1)   
     TRA_em.def                                                               
==== ============================= =========== ===============================

So, for illustration, to set up a model for nitrogen and phosphorus, the user has to provide:

- Input files TNI_em.bin and TNI_em.txt plus TPH_em.bin and TPH_em.txt.
- Alternatively, TNI_em.def and TPH_em.def, holding references to the above files.
- Activation of the relevant process in block 7 of the input file:

::

    CONSTANTS Active_EM_TNI DATA 1
    CONSTANTS Active_EM_TPH DATA 1

- Definition of the “USEFOR” constants to subdivide total N and P over state variables, also in block 7 of the input file:

::

    CONSTANTS TNItoNH4 DATA 0.2
    CONSTANTS TNItoNO3 DATA 0.4
    CONSTANTS TNItoPON1 DATA 0.4

    CONSTANTS TPHtoPO4 DATA 0.5
    CONSTANTS TPHtoAAP DATA 0.4
    CONSTANTS TPHtoPOP1 DATA 0.1

.. note::

    As a simplification, in this tutorial we will model our emitted domestic Nitrogen as a tracer **TRA** to avoid complexity of nutrients modelling and their processes.

Emissions modelling with D-Emission
-----------------------------------
The first step in solving or mitigating many water quality and health problems, is to get a quantitative overview of the emissions of substances causing such problems.
`D-Emissions <www.deltares.nl/en/software/module/D-Emissions/>`_ provides a perfect tool to assess the quantity and spatial distribution of the emitted substances in the catchment. 
Because it simulates the true cause-effect chain, it provides predictive power and allows for “what if” scenarios driven by policy projections and implemented measures.


D-Emissions is a library of the Delwaq software which, in combination with rainfall-runoff and hydraulic modules (e.g. wflow), may form an integral catchment model.

In this section, we will detail the full steps to prepare and run D-Emissions models:

-  Choose the substance(s) of interest and their relevant sources (based on available data)
-  Setup the EM model (from wflow) and emission data using HydroMT
-  Edit the EM run info
-  Run D-Emissions (EM-Plugin).

Selection of substance(s) and sources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The very first part of preparing a water quality model is to define which substances and which emission sources you wish to include in the model. 

When a substance is chosen, the sources (or losses) the user wants to consider can be defined (e.g.: atmospheric deposition, domestic, agriculture...). 
The sources and their emission releases are then quantified or initialized based on available data. There are two types of sources in D-Emissions:

-  Type A: direct substance release rates by the source (usually in g/day, e.g. atmospheric deposition)
-  Type B: substance release rates based on a locator: for example a domestic source can be charaterized by the locator population (in cap) and its emission factor (in g/cap/day).

Then in D-Emissions, the substances can enter the catchment via different receptors that are:

-  Sewage system
-  Paved areas
-  Unpaved areas
-  Stormwater system
-  Surface waters directly
-  Soil

When substances reach the receptors, they can then undergo several processes such as burial or removal by treatment in a WWTP before reaching the final receptors of D-Emissions, 
the surface waters and the soil. The full processes included the D-Emissions model are represented in the scheme below:

.. image:: ../img/D-Emission-pathways.png

As modelling of several substances with multiple sources and processes can be complex, the D-Emissions model has been designed to model
each substance one-by-one. This implies that in order to model several substances, the D-Emissions model needs to be run several times.

For the rest of this topic, we focus on one substance **Total Nitrogen (TN)** released by one source: **households**.

Preparing the EM model with HydroMT
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
D-Emissions (Delwaq) is an unstructured model and composed of unordered segments. D-Emissions segments represent one environmental layer unit (eg open water, soil..). 
The direction of the flows in D-Emissions between each segment is defined in the pointer file. This pointer file defines not only the direction 
of lateral flows between segments (eg discharge), but also the direction of vertical flows (flows between the different layers/compartments of a single geographic cell). 
This means that external flows into / out of a segment (for example precipitation from the atmosphere) are defined in the pointer as flows between a segment and 
a boundary (for precipitation the boundary is the atmosphere).

By only modelling substances one-by-one, the generic D-Emissions version only considers one environment layer which is the **emission or substance layer**. As D-Emissions does not deal 
with fate and transport (no lateral flux between segments), there is then no need to define either a pointer or a boundary file. In essence, D-Emissions calculates the various emitted loads per wflow cell.

To build an EM model with HydroMT you can use the :ref:`**build** command line <model_config>` to prepare all the different :ref:`**components* <model_components>` of your model.
Below is an example ini file for the **Total Nitrogen (TN)** released by **households** example.

As a reminder, for an EM model, the required hydrological data (from wflow_output in our example) is:

- precipitation
- the amount of the precipitation that infiltrates into the soil from unpaved areas
- the amount of the precipation that goes directly to surface runoff from paved areas
- the amount of the precipation that goes directly to surface runoff from unpaved areas

.. literalinclude:: ../_static/delwaq_build_EM_TN.ini
   :language: Ini

.. note::

   In this version of EM, the *the amount of the precipitation that **infiltrates** into the soil from unpaved areas* is dealt with as a sink, since the WQ version does not yet contain a Soil compartment.

Editing the EM run information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In order to run the EM-Plugin of DELWAQ, an input file is used to set up all the relevant run information such as substances and processes to include, run time information, data and model parameters 
to use etc. This is set up in a **.inp** file. A template of such a file, for an EM run, is shown below.

The input file is separated into 10 input blocks each requiring different type of information. You can find more info on what is expected 
where in the `Delwaq input file documentation <content.oss.deltares.nl/delft3d/manuals/D-Water_Quality_Input_File_Description.pdf>`_. In short, the ten blocks are:

- B1: Identification, selected substances
- B2: Timers, integration, monitoring
- B3: Grid and values of the volumes
- B4: Hydrodynamic data
- B5: Open boundary conditions
- B6: Loads and withdrawals
- B7: Process steering
- B8: Initial conditions
- B9: Model output
- B10: Statistical output

With hydroMT, different files were prepared containing information that can be directly linked and included in this input file. These are:

- The different files in the *config* folder: each filename has a prefix containing the block number it should be inserted in (ex: B1_timestamp.inc).
- Emission and other grid data stored in *staticdata* folder
- Time-dependant data such as hydrological fluxes stored in *dynamicdata* folder.
   
Depending on their format (binary or ASCII), the files can be included in the input file using the following syntax.

- For ASCII files: keyword **INCLUDE** + path/to/ascii

::

    INCLUDE 'config\B1_timestamp.inc'

- For binary files: keywords **ALL BINARY_FILE** + path/to/binary

::

    ALL BINARY_FILE 'dynamicdata\hydrology.bin'

In the template below, all (mandatory) files produced by HydroMT have been added and linked. Some explanations on the specificities of the settings for 
the one-substance D-Emissions model:

- In block 1, you can see that in the one-substance D-Emissions model, instead of the substances (nitrogen, TSS...), we model the emission receptors compartments in a specific order. 
  With this, emission modelling can be more generic, run time faster and there is no need to update the procdef tables for each D-Emissions model case.

::

    ;Nr     Name
    1       Sew 
    2       Pav 
    3       Unp 
    4       Stw 
    5       Sfw 
    6       Soi 

- The different emission sources are defined in block 7. Currently, in the one-substance D-Emissions model, **one type A source** and **three type B sources** can be defined. All names 
  respect a certain convention (EV_A01, EV_B01). The user should also define to which receptor (from block 1) the source emission goes to. Here is an example for a type B source :

::

    ; source Type B01
    PARAMETERS EV_B01        ALL BINARY_FILE 'staticdata\GHS-POP_2015.dat' ; locator/EV variable type B    (cap)                
    CONSTANTS  EF_B01           DATA 2.2          ; emission factor                                        (Kg/d/cap)           
    CONSTANTS  B01toSew         DATA 1.0          ; released fraction receptor                             (-)                 
    CONSTANTS  B01toPav         DATA 0.0          ; released fraction receptor                             (-)                 
    CONSTANTS  B01toUnp         DATA 0.0          ; released fraction receptor                             (-)
    CONSTANTS  B01toSoi         DATA 0.0          ; released fraction receptor                             (-)
    CONSTANTS  B01toStw         DATA 0.0          ; released fraction receptor                             (-)
    CONSTANTS  B01toSfw         DATA 0.0          ; released fraction receptor                             (-)

- All unused type A and/or B sources should still be listed in the input file with zero data:

::

    ; source Types NOT USED
    CONSTANTS  EV_A01        DATA 0.    
    CONSTANTS  EV_B02        DATA 0.    
    CONSTANTS  EV_B03        DATA 0.    

.. note::

  The unit of emission factor EF is kg/d/X, where X is the emission unit provided in the Emission Variable EV, e.g. capita for Population.
  Here the EF factor was set to a constant dummy value but you can use HydroMT to prepare and distribute 'real' values from local/global data.

.. literalinclude:: ../_static/espace.inp

Running D-Emission
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In order to run delwaq for D-Emissions, we need to include the EM-Plugin to the run. Delwaq is also run via command lines using two executables, one that reads and process all the information and data 
in the input file **delwaq1.exe**, and one that runs Delwaq with this data **delwaq2.exe**. The command line also include the path to the input file (**espace.inp**) and to 
specific libraries in the EM-Plugin (or D-Emissions plugin). Here is an example:

::

    erase *.wrk
    
    REM Read input
    ..\Delwaq\bin\delwaq1.exe espace.inp -A -p..\EM-Plugin\Tables\proc_def 
    
    REM Simulate
    ..\Delwaq\bin\delwaq2.exe espace.inp -openpb..\EM-Plugin\x64\Release\D3Dwaq_OpenPL.dll
    pause

Water quality modelling with D-Water Quality
--------------------------------------------
The D-Water Quality module simulates the far- and mid-field water and sediment quality due to a variety of transport and water quality processes. To accommodate 
these, it includes several advection diffusion solvers and an extensive library of standardized process formulations with the user-selected substances. Default 
processes allow to simulate for instance the decay of BOD and nitrification, elementary growth of algae and nutrient cycling, exchange of substances with the 
atmosphere, adsorption and desorption of contaminant substances and the deposition and resuspension of particles and adsorbed substances to and from the bed.
D-Water Quality is a module of the DELWAQ software which, in combination with rainfall-runoff and hydraulic modules (e.g. wflow), and the D-Emission module, 
may form an integral catchment model.


In this section, we will detail the steps to run a D-Water Quality model using HydroMT and inputs from D-Emission:

-  Choose the substance(s) of interest and their relevant processes in surface waters
-  Setup the WQ model (from wflow) using HydroMT
-  Edit the WQ run info
-  Include the outputs from D-Emissions
-  Run D-Water Quality (WQ-Plugin)

Selection of substance(s) and processes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When setting-up D-Emission, we decided to model the substance Total Nitrogen (TN) emitted by households. As TN is a  quite complex substance with many processes 
and interactions with different forms of Nitrogen molecule, in the following tutorials, as a simplified example, we will model **Total Nitrogen (TN)** as a 
simple constant tracer cTR.

For more information on available processes per substances, see the Delwaq documentation:
 -  `<content.oss.deltares.nl/delft3d/manuals/D-Water_Quality_Processes_Technical_Reference_Manual.pdf>`_
 -  `<content.oss.deltares.nl/delft3d/manuals/D-Water_Quality_Processes_Library_Tables.pdf>`_
 -  `<content.oss.deltares.nl/delft3d/manuals/D-Water_Quality_Open_Proc_Lib_User_Manual.pdf>`_

Preparing the WQ model with HydroMT
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
D-Water Quality (Delwaq) is an unstructured model and composed of unordered segments. D-Water Quality segments represent one environmental layer unit (eg open water, soil..). 
The direction of the flows in Delwaq between each segment is defined in the pointer file. This pointer file defines not only the direction 
of lateral flows between segments (eg discharge), but also the direction of vertical flows (flows between the different layers/compartments of a single geographic cell). 
This means that external flows into / out of a segment (for example precipitation from the atmosphere) are defined in the pointer as flows between a segment and 
a boundary (for precipitation the boundary is the atmosphere).

Compared to D-Emission, lateral transport of the substance in the surface water between Delwaq segments is considered and a pointer file is then necessary.

To build an WQ model with HydroMT you can use the :ref:`**build** command line <model_config>` to prepare all the different :ref:`**components* <model_components>` of your model.
Below is an example ini file for the **Total Nitrogen (TN)** released by **households** example.

As a reminder, for a WQ model, the required hydrological data (from wflow_output in our example) is:

- surface runoff
- surface water volumes
- total water entering the surface waters (e.g. precipitation, exfiltration from the soil, evaporation…) in order to close the surface water mass balance

.. literalinclude:: ../_static/delwaq_build_WQ_TN.ini
   :language: Ini

.. note::

   In some cases, you may require some additional GIS data in order to run a WQ model, for example, when you do not need to run the D-Emission model beforehand, 
   but include point sources that emit pollutants into the surface water directly. When this is the case, you can still use the various [setup_emission_*] components of hydroMT_delwaq.

Editing the WQ run information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In order to run the WQ-Plugin of DELWAQ, an input file is used to set up all the relevant run information such as substances and processes to include, run time information, data and model parameters 
to use etc. This is set up in a **.inp** file. A template of such a file, for an WQ run, is shown below.

The input file is separated into 10 input blocks each requiring different type of information. You can find more info on what is expected 
where in the `Delwaq input file documentation <content.oss.deltares.nl/delft3d/manuals/D-Water_Quality_Input_File_Description.pdf>`_. In short, the ten blocks are:

- B1: Identification, selected substances
- B2: Timers, integration, monitoring
- B3: Grid and values of the volumes
- B4: Hydrodynamic data
- B5: Open boundary conditions
- B6: Loads and withdrawals
- B7: Process steering
- B8: Initial conditions
- B9: Model output
- B10: Statistical output

With hydroMT, different files were prepared containing information that can be directly linked and included in this input file. These are:

- The different files in the *config* folder: each filename has a prefix containing the block number it should be inserted in (ex: B1_timestamp.inc).
- Emission and other grid data stored in *staticdata* folder
- Time-dependant data such as hydrological fluxes stored in *dynamicdata* folder.
   
Depending on their format (binary or ASCII), the files can be included in the input file using the following syntax.

- For ASCII files: keyword **INCLUDE** + path/to/ascii

::

    INCLUDE 'config\B1_timestamp.inc'

- For binary files: keywords **ALL BINARY_FILE** + path/to/binary

::

    ALL BINARY_FILE 'dynamicdata\hydrology.bin'

In the template below, all (mandatory) files produced by HydroMT have been added and linked. Some explanations on the specificities of the settings for 
the D-Water Quality linked to one-substance D-Emissions models:

- In block 1, you can see that we are going to model TN as a tracer for simplification (less expert processes to define). The generic name for a tracer in Delwaq is **cTR1**:

::

    ;Nr      Name
    1       cTR1

- The boundary conditions and initial concentrations of our substance **cTR1** needs to be defined in block 5 and 8 respectively and can be initialized with zero:

::

    ITEM BD_1    CONCENTRATIONS cTR1 DATA 0.0
    #5

::

    INITIALS  cTR1 DEFAULTS  0.0
    #8

- The link of our tracer **TRA** with D-Emissions output and to the relevant process is activated in block 7 of the input file (1st line), the 2nd line is added to map all of the emitted tracer *Tra* to a conservative tracer substance *cTR1* (Note: not used in this tutorial, but EM also supports to simulate a decayable tracer *dTR1*, which requires to also define decay rates):

::

    CONSTANTS Active_EM_TRA DATA 1
    CONSTANTS TratocTR1     DATA 1.0

.. literalinclude:: ../_static/delwaq.inp

Link with the outputs from D-Emissions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In the new D-Water Quality connection with the single-substance D-Emissions version, there are two ways to provide the outputs of the D-Emissions run to the WQ model for a tracer **TRA**:

- Copy the outputs of the D-Emissions model run *outdata_em.bin* and *outdata_em.txt* and paste them in the WQ model directory. Rename them following the tracer 
  convention: *TRA_em.bin* and *TRA_em.txt*.

OR

- Use a file named *TRA_em.def*, placed in the WQ model directory, that contains the (relative) paths to the D-Emissions results.

::

    path/to/outdata_em.txt
    path/to/outdata_em.bin

.. note::

    The Delwaq software is not case sensitive. Filenames can therefore either be TRA_em.def or tra_em.def etc.

Running D-Water Quality
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In order to run delwaq for D-Water Quality, we need to include the WQ-Plugin to the run. Delwaq is also run via command lines using two executables, one that reads and process all the information and data 
in the input file **delwaq1.exe**, and one that runs Delwaq with this data **delwaq2.exe**. The command line also include the path to the input file (**delwaq.inp**) and to 
   specific libraries in the WQ-Plugin (or D-Water Quality plugin). You can also notice that there is no direct link to the outdata_em files either in the delwaq.inp or in the 
   run-WQ-tra.bat files. This is why respecting the naming conventions of either xxx_em.bin and xxx_em.txt or xxx_em.def are mandatory.
