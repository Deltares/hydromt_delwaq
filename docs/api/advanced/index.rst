######################
Advanced API reference
######################

The advanced HydroMT-DELWAQ API exposes the underlying classes, workflows, and utility
functions used to build, extend, and customize DELWAQ models. These interfaces are primarily
intended for developers and advanced users who want to script model setup workflows, create
custom preprocessing routines, or integrate HydroMT-DELWAQ components into other systems.

The API is organized into the following sections:

- :ref:`Model components <api_components>`: Classes and functions for handling specific model components like config, staticdata, and forcing.
- :ref:`Workflows <workflows>`: Predefined workflows for common tasks such as setting up basemaps, emission data, hydrology forcing etc.
