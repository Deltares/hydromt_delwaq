Reading more about coupling the individual modules
==================================================

A complete setup of a water quality model using DELWAQ consists of a hydrological model (Wflow), an emission model (D-Emissions), and an instream fate and transport model (D-Water Quality).
These three models need to be coupled. This section describes how to couple the individual modules:
